	- consider using version and install sql from fabfitfun
	- use separate db name (markthegonzales)
- move current ace to mark
- add google analytics to deploy script
- add logrotate.sh to sire/_common/_bin (or just sire/bin, though these should be merged)
	- pass it $installDir so it can check $installDir/post_log_rotate.sh
		- in the for loop, check if arg.indexOf('installDir=') == 0
	- rotate nginx (and other) logs on sire/mark deploy script
	- see if other logs in other repos on same server need rotating
- disable theme (and other) updates from admin
	- see what i did with fff
- add relevant instructions from hope's notes.txt to this file
- automatically resize images on upload so we dont run out of space
	- maybe do this with node cron since php image resize sucks
	- make sure they get uploaded to s3
